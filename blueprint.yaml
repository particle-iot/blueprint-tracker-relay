introduction: |
  This application note shows how you can use relays with the Tracker One M8 connector. It includes two designs:

  - Quad Relay (4x 10A SPDT relays)
  - Dual Latching Relay (2x 16A SPDT latching relays)

  This application note demonstrates adding relays to the Tracker One using the M8 connector. It includes two designs:

  - Quad Relay: Utilizes 4x 10A SPDT relays for non-latching applications.
  - Dual Latching Relay: Utilizes 2x 16A SPDT latching relays for applications where power-saving is critical.

  The example code also includes Particle functions for controlling relay states, supporting integration with various Particle tools (CLI, console, mobile app).
