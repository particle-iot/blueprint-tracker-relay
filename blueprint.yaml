  This application note demonstrates adding relays to the Tracker One using the M8 connector. It includes two designs:

  - Quad Relay: Utilizes 4x 10A SPDT relays for non-latching applications.
  - Dual Latching Relay: Utilizes 2x 16A SPDT latching relays for applications where power-saving is critical.

  The example code also includes Particle functions for controlling relay states, supporting integration with various Particle tools (CLI, console, mobile app).
